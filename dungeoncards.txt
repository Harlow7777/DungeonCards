		Athlete - Controlled Dash: After defeating a boss, draw a card, move that number of squares in any direction of your choice, discard that card
		Soldier - Strong Will: If you are defeated by a boss, you can make a saving draw which replaces the last draw you made in combat
		Tank - Damage Sponge: You start with 5 extra lives

		Swordsman - Guard Break: On a tie, you do 1 damage to the Boss
		Multiplayer classes:

Each turn:
	**Players start with a hand of 3 cards, redraw face cards
	Draw card:
		**Select a card to use
		Move character number of spaces = value of the card
		Ace value = 1
		In the direction indicated by the suit:
			Diamonds - Up
			Spades - Down
			Hearts - Left
			Clubs - Right
		If you encounter a wall(edge of board) movement stops
		Card is placed in the discard pile
	Combat:
		**If you draw a face card you must immediately lay it down and fight the boss
		Face cards = Bosses:
			Jack - 3 lives
			Queen - 4 lives
				Second Wind: On defeat the Queen redraws her final card, replacing the first card she drew
			King - 5 lives
				Royal Barrage: On a King's final life, he will start by drawing 3 cards
				The player draws 3 and damage is taken 3 seperate times for each matchup
		*Once you defeat a boss, it will not get shuffled back into the deck
		On a boss encounter:
			*In multiplayer, only players adjacent to the character in combat may help fight(each player draws a card for every boss draw)
			Battle stops all movement, until the player beats the boss or dies trying
			Shuffle discard pile into the deck
			Boss draws a card
			You draw a card
			The owner of the lower valued card takes 1 damage
			Place both cards in discard pile
			*Face cards drawn during combat are immediately put into discard pile and the player redraws
			*Ties end in no damage, cards are placed in the discard pile
			At the end of combat, shuffle the discard pile into the deck
		Victory:
			Once a boss has been defeated a player can put 1 point of experience into one stat	
			The player also gains 1 level
	*If at any point the deck runs out of cards, shuffle the discard pile and place as new deck

Winning:
	A player escapes the dungeon if the Joker representing the Exit is landed on
	A player falls and dies, ending the game, if the Joker representing the Pit is landed on
	On escape note each players level and stats, add to Hall of Fame
	*In multiplayer:
		Once a player reaches the Exit, the remainder of the team can finish the game, counting it as a team victory
		Or the remainder of the team can continue playing until each character has either died, fallen into a pit, or escaped
